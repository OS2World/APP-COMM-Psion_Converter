This is the basic psiconv generator. It generates plain HTML that should be
readable on any HTML-3.2 compliant browser (at this moment, a few codes are
probably unknown; one of the next versions will have completely validated
HTML-3.2 output).

Note that tabs, headers and footers are not rendered at all. Especially
the omission of tabs can cause ugly layouts. Unfortunately, there is not
a real solution for this.
